# üßê Project philosophy

> This is an IoT based device which helps you to update your slack status on your fingertips.
> I have included 5 status you just need to press it and change the slack status as written on it.
> If you are a person who uses slack on daily basis, then you need to change your slack status frequently. That's why I made this IoT device for that

**I got inspiration from this blog(https://www.instructables.com/Slack-Status-Updater-With-ESP8266).**


# üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack this device uses:

- The code is written in C language and I have used Ardiuno Ide.
- Development board I used is esp8266

For more information on the technologies that power the Well app, check out the [Tech Stack](https://github.com/chroline/well_app/wiki/Tech-Stack) page on our wiki.

# ‚úçÔ∏è How to make one 

- You need an IoT board ex: Esp8266 or Esp32
- Install all libraries (see the blog)
- Create a slack app
- Install it you are ready

# üåü Spread the word!

If you want to say thank you and/or support active development of the Well app:

- Add a GitHub Star to the project!
- Tweet about the project on your Twitter!
-Leave a like on Linkedin

Thanks so much for your interest in growing the reach of the project!
